      Thanks for taking part in our experiment! The experiment will take approximately 2-3 minutes.
      <br />
      <br />
      In this experiment, we will ask you what you think about other people's intentions in everyday contexts.
      On each trial, you will read a short description of a situation wherein a person utters a sentence. 
      <b>We will ask you if you think a statement about that person's uttance is true or false.</b>
      <br />
